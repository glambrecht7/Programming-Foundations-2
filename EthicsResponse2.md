Prompt: While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

---

____Option 1____ : Do whats best for the Consultancy and do what the customer wants.

Pros: The customer is happy with the result of the product and the boss of the consultancy is happy with a happy customer.
Positive review of the company and possible promotion for good work.
Customer is increasing revenue and productivity in the company.

Cons: 175 people will lose their job.

Script: Customer: Hey company, can you create machience learning software that will improve costomer efficiency. With it, I will be able to lay off employees on pay roll which will go elsewhere in the company, about 175 employees.
Me: Sure, I will get started on that right away. Thank you for choosing our Consultancy to assist you!


Scipture Proverbs 16:3 – Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established. When you create a business idea and plan and share it with God, He can make sure that you accomplish it. There's nothing like inviting God to be a part of your business.

____Option 2____ : Design a system to utalize the 175 employees while also using machine learning.

Pros: There is a middle ground between laying off 175 employees and using machine learning. I am not sure of such a system that would accomplish this, but if there was, it would save a lot of careers.

Cons: Unsure of the reality of this solution and may not be acheivable.

Script: Customer: Hey company, can you create machience learning software that will improve costomer efficiency. With it, I will be able to lay off employees on pay roll which will go elsewhere in the company, about 175 employees.
Me: I can see how this upgrade to machience learing would be beneficial to you company in the sense that you would be able to maximise profit by laying off employees, however, we could alternativly create a solution to repurpose your 175 employees to interact with machience learing while saving careers?
Customer: That sounds like it could make everyone happy!

Scipture:“With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.” “You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.” “Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do.”

____Option 3____ : Deny the customers request and say that it is not my position to determine the fate of 175 employee careers.

Pros : The stress of knowing that 175 employees would lose their jobs would be gone, therefore saving the careers of the employees.

Cons : Boss at the consultancy may terminate or write me up for not doing my job.
Can cause the customer to spread a negative complection of the company, therefore turning away potentail customers.

Script: Customer: Hey company, can you create machience learning software that will improve costomer efficiency. With it, I will be able to lay off employees on pay roll which will go elsewhere in the company, about 175 employees.
Me: I am sorry, ethically speaking, I cannot deterime the fate and careers of 175 employees. I could be responsible for a multitude of tragities and problems that could result from people losing their jobs.
Customer: Im calling your supervisor!

Scipture: Galatians 5:1 NIV "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery."

____Conclusion____

It is important for an employees to perform their job that satisfies the needs of their team and or boss. However, there are times were someone is put into a situation to determine the fate and careers of other people and that desicion is morally and ethically difficult to make. 
In a situation like this, finding a middle ground is the most attractive option to the person who is designing the product. However, it may not be that easy and a solution may end up costing more than just doing the original work that the customer intended.

____My Choice____
Out of the options above, I would personally choose option 1. There are many other consequences that could happen to me if I refuse to do a service for a customer. I could get fired or written up if I deny and the customer could make the Consultancy look bad in the public eye which will drive away customers. Although, it would be hard to see 175 employees lose their careers, people today must understand that technological advances are being made every day and we must adjust to the circumstances.
